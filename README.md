**SET THE CPU TO X86 AFTER OPENING THE SOLUTION** Otherwise you may get error messages saying you need to install an emulator and that the project cannot deploy.




# suggestions for improvement

- Make the binary text block display the number separated by nibblets.

- Add a 'convert' button with a corresponding input field where you can type in a number, press convert, and it gives you the number in binary form. It would be cool if this functionality was synced with the add 1 button and operated on the same variable.

-Make it pretty.

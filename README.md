# suggestions for improvement

- Make the binary text block display the number separated by nibbles.

- Make it pretty.

- Make the counter/converter function with negative numbers.

- Make a congratulations message for reaching the limit of a 14 bit number when the add1 button is clicked and value is 16383.
